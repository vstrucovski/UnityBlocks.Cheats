## üì¶ How to install
1. Require Git for installing package.
2. Open Unity Package Manager (Window > Package Manager).
3. Add package via git URL
```
https://github.com/vstrucovski/UnityBlocks.Cheats.git
```
OR add directly to manifest
```
"unityblocks.cheats": "https://github.com/vstrucovski/UnityBlocks.Cheats.git"
```

## üïπÔ∏è How to Use
#### 1. Add Cheats Panel to Scene
Simply drag the Cheats prefab from the package into your game scene.
The panel will automatically populate with buttons from any ICheatCommands components in the scene.

#### 2. Create Custom Cheat Commands
To add new buttons to the cheat panel, create a new MonoBehaviour and implement the ICheatCommands interface.
```csharp
    [AddComponentMenu("Cheats/Player Prefs Cheats", 99)]
    public class PrefsCheatCommands : MonoBehaviour, ICheatCommands
    {
        [CheatCommand("All")]
        private void ResetSaves(object _)
        {
            PlayerPrefs.DeleteAll();
            PlayerPrefs.Save();
            Debug.Log("All player prefs are cleared. Please restart the application");
        }
    }
```
_Example: Resetting Player Preferences_

#### üìù Important Notes:
Cheat Commands must be decorated with the [CheatCommand] attribute.

The attribute accepts two parameters:
- Command Value (required)
- Category: Groups commands into categories (optional)

#### 3. Register Commands: Ensure all command components are added to the CheatSetup object in the scene.
